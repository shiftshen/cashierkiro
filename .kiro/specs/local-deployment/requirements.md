# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables local deployment of the cashier/POS system while maintaining connectivity to the online data source (https://www.vdamo.com). The system is a uni-app framework based point-of-sale application using Vue 2, uView UI components, Vuex state management, and WebSocket real-time communication. It needs to run locally for development and testing purposes while consuming live data from the production API.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to set up the project for local development, so that I can run and test the cashier system on my local machine.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is cloned locally THEN the system SHALL install all required dependencies successfully
2. WHEN the development environment is configured THEN the system SHALL connect to the online API at https://www.vdamo.com
3. WHEN the local server starts THEN the system SHALL be accessible via localhost with proper routing
4. WHEN API calls are made THEN the system SHALL successfully fetch data from the online endpoints

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the configuration to automatically switch between development and production modes, so that the system uses appropriate settings for each environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN NODE_ENV is set to 'development' THEN the system SHALL use development-specific configurations
2. WHEN NODE_ENV is set to 'production' THEN the system SHALL use the production API root (https://www.vdamo.com)
3. WHEN running locally THEN the system SHALL maintain API connectivity to the online data source
4. WHEN configuration changes are made THEN the system SHALL reflect changes without requiring manual restarts

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to verify that all core functionalities work with online data, so that I can ensure the local deployment is successful.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the login functionality is tested THEN the system SHALL authenticate users against the online API
2. WHEN cashier operations are performed THEN the system SHALL process transactions using online data
3. WHEN member management is accessed THEN the system SHALL retrieve and update member information from the online database
4. WHEN reports are generated THEN the system SHALL fetch real-time data from the online source

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling and debugging capabilities, so that I can troubleshoot issues during local development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API calls fail THEN the system SHALL display meaningful error messages
2. WHEN network connectivity issues occur THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate fallback behavior
3. WHEN debugging is needed THEN the system SHALL provide console logging for development mode
4. WHEN CORS issues arise THEN the system SHALL handle cross-origin requests properly

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want documentation for the local setup process, so that other team members can easily deploy the system locally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the project THEN there SHALL be clear installation instructions
2. WHEN configuring the environment THEN there SHALL be documented steps for environment setup
3. WHEN troubleshooting issues THEN there SHALL be a troubleshooting guide available
4. WHEN running different commands THEN there SHALL be documented npm/yarn scripts for common tasks
