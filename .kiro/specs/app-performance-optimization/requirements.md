# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the critical performance gap between web browsers and mobile app shells (WebView) for the DAMO Cashier system. The system currently experiences significant performance degradation when packaged as a mobile app compared to running in native browsers. This optimization focuses on WebView configuration, build optimization, resource management, and runtime performance improvements to achieve near-native app performance.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a mobile app user, I want the app to load and respond as quickly as a web browser, so that I can efficiently process transactions without delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app launches THEN the system SHALL achieve first screen load time within 3 seconds (down from current 8-10 seconds)
2. WHEN navigating between pages THEN the system SHALL respond within 500ms (down from current 2-3 seconds)
3. WHEN performing touch interactions THEN the system SHALL provide immediate visual feedback within 100ms
4. WHEN the app is backgrounded and resumed THEN the system SHALL restore state within 1 second

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to optimize the WebView configuration and build process, so that the app uses hardware acceleration and optimized JavaScript execution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app is built for Android THEN the system SHALL enable hardware acceleration and JIT compilation
2. WHEN the app is built for iOS THEN the system SHALL use optimized WKWebView configuration with proper caching
3. WHEN building the app THEN the system SHALL use production builds with minification and tree-shaking enabled
4. WHEN packaging resources THEN the system SHALL implement code splitting and lazy loading for non-critical modules

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a restaurant operator, I want the table management and weighing functions to work smoothly offline, so that operations continue during network interruptions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing table status THEN the system SHALL use local caching with smart polling (10-second intervals instead of 3-second)
2. WHEN using the weighing function THEN the system SHALL calculate prices locally and sync asynchronously to server
3. WHEN network is unavailable THEN the system SHALL queue operations and sync when connection is restored
4. WHEN switching between online/offline modes THEN the system SHALL maintain seamless user experience

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a mobile app user, I want images and resources to load quickly, so that the interface feels responsive and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading images THEN the system SHALL use WebP/AVIF formats with appropriate compression (target <200KB per image)
2. WHEN displaying icons THEN the system SHALL use SVG sprites or optimized icon fonts instead of large bitmap fonts
3. WHEN loading fonts THEN the system SHALL use font subsetting to reduce file sizes by 70%
4. WHEN caching resources THEN the system SHALL implement PWA caching strategies for offline availability

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to eliminate main thread blocking, so that the app remains responsive during heavy operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing large JSON data THEN the system SHALL use Web Workers for parsing and computation
2. WHEN rendering large lists THEN the system SHALL implement virtual scrolling to limit DOM nodes
3. WHEN handling frequent updates THEN the system SHALL use debouncing and throttling for input events
4. WHEN managing state THEN the system SHALL optimize Vuex/Pinia reactivity to prevent unnecessary re-renders

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want monitoring and debugging tools, so that I can identify and resolve performance bottlenecks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performance issues occur THEN the system SHALL provide detailed performance metrics and logging
2. WHEN debugging is needed THEN the system SHALL offer development tools for profiling WebView performance
3. WHEN monitoring app usage THEN the system SHALL track key performance indicators (load time, memory usage, crash rates)
4. WHEN optimizations are applied THEN the system SHALL provide before/after performance comparisons

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a mobile app user, I want the app to work efficiently on older devices, so that hardware limitations don't prevent smooth operation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running on devices with limited RAM THEN the system SHALL maintain memory usage below 150MB
2. WHEN running on slower processors THEN the system SHALL prioritize critical rendering paths
3. WHEN battery optimization is needed THEN the system SHALL minimize CPU-intensive operations
4. WHEN storage is limited THEN the system SHALL implement efficient caching strategies with automatic cleanup

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated build optimization, so that performance improvements are consistently applied across all app builds.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building the app THEN the system SHALL automatically apply image compression and format conversion
2. WHEN bundling JavaScript THEN the system SHALL implement automatic code splitting based on route boundaries
3. WHEN generating builds THEN the system SHALL create optimized manifest configurations for each platform
4. WHEN deploying updates THEN the system SHALL validate performance benchmarks before release
